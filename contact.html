				Welcome, stranger. This is where you may contact the author of this webpage for whatever reason
				it is you may have for doing so. So what you're going to do, what you will do, is you're going to
				click that link below, right down there. And it's going to be clicked by you, and what's gonna happen,
				what is gonna happen, is it's going to open up an e-mail addressed to the author, to the guy's e-mail address
				who is in that clickable text, right down below, the one you just clicked. It's gonna start an e-mail for
				you, and it's going to be a beautiful thing, and if it isn't, I'm going to give you a small loan of
				one million dollars- <br/><br/><br/><br/>Okay, maybe not really, I'm broke as hell.
