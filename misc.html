	<h3>Read about aliens</h3>
		<div class="divider">
			<p>
				Specifically, fictional works detailing how aliens invaded Earth, decimating the human population. Only to find
				that the humans were the least of their concerns. They would fall victim to horrid diseases brought on by
				mosquitos, lose entire armies to a pack of two bears, and have their scent glands poisoned by skunks.

	<h3>Adopt new views</h3>
		<div class="divider">
			<p>
				Or at least entertain alternate ways of thinking. Ask questions about the ideologies of that one person who you
				strongly disagree with, questioning why they think the way they do. Be respectful, and try and word your questions
				in a way that makes them question their beliefs in a profound and meaninful way.
